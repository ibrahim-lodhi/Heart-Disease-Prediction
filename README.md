# Heart-Disease-Prediction


**1. Notebook Overview**
The file appears to be a data science or machine learning project focused on cardiovascular health. It involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and potentially model training to predict or analyze cardiovascular conditions.

**2. Structure and Key Sections**
The notebook includes the following sections:

**Imports and Libraries**
Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and visualization tools (e.g., matplotlib, seaborn) are imported. This suggests the project involves data manipulation and visualization.

**Data Loading**
A dataset related to cardiovascular health is loaded, likely in CSV format. Initial inspection and understanding of the dataset are performed using pandas.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Insights are derived from the data using visualization tools. Common analyses include:
Distribution of variables (e.g., age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure).
Relationships between features (e.g., scatter plots, correlation matrices).

**Data Preprocessing**
Steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling, or normalization are undertaken.
Feature engineering or selection might be present to refine the dataset for analysis.

**Algorithms**
Classification models might be used (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods) to predict cardiovascular disease.
The file may include model training, validation, and performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).

**Visualization**
Includes plots like histograms, boxplots, or heatmaps to provide insights into the dataset and model results.

**Importing Libraries**
The notebook begins by importing essential libraries for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning:

**Data Manipulation: numpy, pandas**
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Modeling and Evaluation:
Models: LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier, RandomForestClassifier
Tools: train_test_split, RandomizedSearchCV, GridSearchCV
Metrics: confusion_matrix, classification_report, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

**Dataset Loading**
The dataset is loaded from a file named Heart_Disease_Prediction new.csv.
Quick exploratory commands are run to check the dataset:
df.head(): Displays the first five rows.
df.shape: Shows the dimensions of the dataset.
df.tail(): Displays the last five rows.
