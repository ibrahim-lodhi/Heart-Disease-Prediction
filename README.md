# Heart-Disease-Prediction

**Problem overview**
Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths annually. This number is expected to rise due to lifestyle changes, urbanization, and aging populations. Contributing factors include unhealthy diets, sedentary lifestyles, smoking, stress, and limited access to preventive healthcare.

**The Role of Machine Learning in Combating Heart Disease**
Machine learning (ML) offers transformative potential in addressing the growing heart disease epidemic. By leveraging vast datasets, ML algorithms can uncover patterns, predict risks, and guide interventions.

**Notebook Overview**
The file appears to be a data science or machine learning project focused on cardiovascular health. It involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and potentially model training to predict or analyze cardiovascular conditions.

**Markdown Documentation**
Overview:
The project is identified as a Heart Disease Prediction Project with the following workflow:
Problem identification.
Data exploration.
Model evaluation.
Feature engineering.
Modeling.
Experimentation.

**Key Focus**:
Analysis of gender-based ratios in heart disease prevalence.
Selection of three primary models for prediction:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest
Logistic Regression

**Imports and Libraries**
Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and visualization tools (e.g., matplotlib, seaborn) are imported. this project involves data manipulation and visualization.

**Data Loading**
A dataset related to cardiovascular health is loaded, likely in CSV format. Initial inspection and understanding of the dataset are performed using pandas.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Insights are derived from the data using visualization tools. Common analyses include:
Distribution of variables (e.g., age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure).
Relationships between features (e.g., scatter plots, correlation matrices).

**Data Preprocessing**
Steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling, or normalization are undertaken.
Feature engineering or selection might be present to refine the dataset for analysis.

**Algorithms**
Classification models might be used (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods) to predict cardiovascular disease.
The file may include model training, validation, and performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).

**Visualization**
Includes plots like histograms, scatter plots or heatmaps to provide insights into the dataset and model results.

**Importing Libraries**
The notebook begins by importing essential libraries for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning:

**Data Manipulation: numpy, pandas**
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Modeling and Evaluation:
